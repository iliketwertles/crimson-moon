# Crimson Moon:full_moon:
right now it only has backup/changing of the boot animation, improvements to that and other features will come with time/suggestions

idk what else to put here but if you break your device its not my fault

## Requirements
the only requirements are dev mode and root access, on flex you have to do some hackery to get dev mode but it is possible

## Building
1. who buildin this? :skull:
2. its nim, `nim c FILE`
